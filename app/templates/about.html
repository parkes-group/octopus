        <h1 class="mb-4">How Agile Pricing Helps You Find the Cheapest Octopus Energy Prices</h1>

        <p class="lead">
            Agile Pricing helps UK households on the Agile Octopus tariff find the <strong>cheapest half-hourly electricity prices</strong> each day, making it easier to reduce energy bills by shifting usage to lower-cost periods.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            By analysing official Octopus Energy pricing data in near real time, the tool highlights the <strong>cheapest blocks of time to use electricity</strong> — ideal for charging home batteries, electric vehicles, and running flexible or energy-intensive appliances when prices are lowest.

                    <li>Have home battery storage (such as Tesla Powerwall, GivEnergy, Solax, etc.)</li>
                    <li>May also have solar panels (optional but common)</li>
                    <li>Want to reduce electricity costs by using power at cheaper times</li>

                <p class="mb-0">
                    The tool helps you quickly identify the best times of day to charge batteries, charge EVs, or run appliances while avoiding expensive peak periods.

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Find the <strong>cheapest 30-minute electricity price</strong> of the day</li>
                    <li>Identify the <strong>cheapest continuous charging blocks</strong>, from 30 minutes up to 6 hours</li>
                    <li>See the <strong>cheapest remaining time windows</strong> later in the day</li>
                    <li>Estimate electricity costs based on selected time periods</li>
                    <li>View interactive charts showing half-hourly price changes</li>
                    <li>Compare prices across different UK electricity regions</li>

                <p>
                    Electricity prices on the Agile Octopus tariff can vary significantly throughout the day. By shifting usage to the cheapest half-hourly periods, many households are able to <strong>reduce electricity costs compared to flat or standard variable tariffs</strong>.

                <p class="mb-0">
                    Agile Pricing makes these low-cost windows easy to spot, helping you plan battery charging, EV charging, and flexible appliance use during the cheapest blocks of time — and avoid the most expensive peak hours.

                <h2 class="h4 mb-3">What Is the Agile Octopus Electricity Tariff?</h2>
                <p>
                    Agile Octopus is a time-of-use electricity tariff offered by Octopus Energy in the UK. Unlike traditional fixed or standard variable tariffs, Agile Octopus prices change every 30 minutes based on wholesale electricity market conditions.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    This means electricity prices can be:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cheaper</strong> during periods of low demand or high renewable generation</li>
                    <li><strong>More expensive</strong> during peak demand times</li>
                    <li><strong>Negative</strong> on rare occasions, meaning you may be paid to use electricity</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    Agile Octopus rewards households that can shift electricity usage to cheaper periods.

                <p>
                    All electricity pricing data shown on Agile Pricing comes directly from <strong>Octopus Energy’s official public API</strong>.
                </p>
                <ul class="mb-3">
                    <li><strong>Data source:</strong> Octopus Energy public API</li>
