        <p class="lead">
            Agile Pricing helps UK households understand Agile Octopus electricity prices and identify the cheapest times to use electricity, particularly for charging home batteries, electric vehicles, and other flexible appliances.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
            By analysing half-hourly pricing data from Octopus Energy, the tool highlights low-cost and negative-price periods so you can make more informed decisions about when to use energy.

                <h2 class="h4 mb-3">What Is Agile Octopus?</h2>
                <p>
                    Agile Octopus is a time-of-use electricity tariff offered by Octopus Energy in the UK. Unlike traditional fixed or standard variable tariffs, Agile Octopus prices change every 30 minutes based on wholesale electricity market conditions.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                    This means electricity prices can be:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cheaper</strong> during periods of low demand or high renewable generation</li>
                    <li><strong>More expensive</strong> during peak demand times</li>
                    <li><strong>Negative</strong> on rare occasions, meaning you may be paid to use electricity</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    Agile Octopus rewards households that can shift electricity usage to cheaper periods.

                    All pricing data shown on this site comes directly from Octopus Energy's official public API.
                </p>
                <ul class="mb-3">

                    <li><strong>Update frequency:</strong> Every 30 minutes (half-hourly pricing)</li>
                    <li><strong>Coverage:</strong> All 14 UK electricity regions</li>
                    <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Unit rates include VAT and are shown in pence per kWh</li>
