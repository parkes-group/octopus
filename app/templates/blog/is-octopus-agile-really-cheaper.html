        This is an evidence-led explainer based on <strong>real Octopus Agile pricing data</strong>, using the site’s <strong>2025 national average</strong> statistics generated from half-hourly prices.
        To verify these conclusions for your own household, start on the <a href="{{ url_for('main.index') }}">homepage</a> by entering your postcode — you’ll see your region’s live Agile prices and highlighted cheapest and most expensive windows.

        <strong>Octopus Agile is not always cheaper.</strong>
        Whether it saves money depends primarily on <em>when</em> electricity is used, especially during winter evening peak hours.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        That’s not marketing. It’s the main trade-off of time‑of‑use pricing: the tariff can be genuinely cheap at some times,
        and punishingly expensive at others.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2 class="h4">TL;DR</h2>
      <ul class="mb-0">
        <li><strong>Cheaper for some households</strong> (if you can avoid expensive windows)</li>
        <li><strong>More expensive for others</strong> (if your usage is concentrated in peak hours)</li>

      </ul>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2 class="h4">Why trust this analysis (and how to verify it)</h2>
      <p>
        This post is deliberately sceptical: Agile is not “always cheaper”, and some households do lose money on it.
        The goal here is to explain <em>why</em> that happens using transparent, reproducible numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>AgilePricing exists to answer a single question accurately: is Agile cheaper for this household, in this region, right now?</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        AgilePricing exists to help you verify the trade‑offs using <strong>live, regional</strong> Agile prices:
        enter your postcode on the <a href="{{ url_for('main.index') }}">homepage</a> to identify your region, then use the regional tools to see the
        <strong>latest cheapest and most expensive half‑hour windows</strong> for that region (and how they line up with your routine).
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2 class="h4">A trust-first starting point: who Agile often doesn’t suit</h2>
      <p>
        Agile is not a hack and it is not a guaranteed saving. It rewards certain usage patterns—and penalises others.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        If your household uses a large share of electricity in the early evening (cooking, lights, appliances, and in some homes
        heating or hot water), Agile often does <em>not</em> suit you—especially in winter.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2 class="h4">The core idea: it rewards timing, not volume</h2>
      <p class="mb-0">
        <strong>Agile pricing rewards *when* you use electricity, not how much.</strong>
        That is the whole mechanism. The same household can pay very different amounts depending on whether usage lands in cheaper periods or in peak hours.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>What the 2025 national data says (no hype)</h2>
      <p>Using the 2025 national average:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Daily average Agile price:</strong> {{ stats_daily_avg_p_per_kwh }}p/kWh</li>
        <li><strong>Cheapest 3.5-hour block average:</strong> {{ stats_cheapest_block_avg_p_per_kwh }}p/kWh</li>
        <li><strong>Peak window ({{ stats_peak_window_start }}–{{ stats_peak_window_end }}) average:</strong> {{ stats_peak_avg_p_per_kwh }}p/kWh</li>
        <li><strong>Off-peak average:</strong> {{ stats_offpeak_avg_p_per_kwh }}p/kWh</li>
        <li><strong>Peak premium vs off-peak:</strong> {{ stats_peak_premium_pct }}%</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-0">
        Those figures are why Agile is not “always cheaper”: the same tariff contains both bargain windows and expensive spikes.
        If your usage lands in the spikes, the average doesn’t protect you.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>1) Winter behaviour (Nov–Feb): why evenings can wipe out savings</h2>
      <p>
        Winter is where many households get caught out because both <em>the level</em> and <em>the shape</em> of prices tend to be harsher.
        The 2025 national <strong>winter average price</strong> is <strong>{{ stats_winter_avg_p_per_kwh }}p/kWh</strong>, compared with a
        <strong>summer average</strong> of <strong>{{ stats_summer_avg_p_per_kwh }}p/kWh</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the bigger issue is the evening peak. The 2025 national average for the <strong>{{ stats_peak_window_start }}–{{ stats_peak_window_end }}</strong> window is
        <strong>{{ stats_peak_avg_p_per_kwh }}p/kWh</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        That’s the danger zone for “normal” household routines: dinner cooking, lighting, laundry, showers, and lots of appliance use.
        If your electricity use is evening‑heavy, winter peak pricing can wipe out savings from cheaper periods.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>2) Summer behaviour (May–Aug): why Agile can look “easy”</h2>
      <p>
        Summer tends to be less volatile and less punishing, with more usable low-price windows.
        The 2025 national <strong>summer average price</strong> is <strong>{{ stats_summer_avg_p_per_kwh }}p/kWh</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        This is why Agile can outperform a fixed tariff even with imperfect behaviour: you don’t need to optimise every appliance,
        but you do need to avoid living in the peak window.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>3) Usage pattern scenarios</h2>

      <h3 class="h5 mt-3">If you use most electricity between 5pm and 7pm</h3>
      <p class="mb-0">
        You’re exposed to the most expensive part of the day. In the 2025 national data, the peak window averages <strong>{{ stats_peak_avg_p_per_kwh }}p/kWh</strong>.
        If that describes your household (common for families and “out all day, home for dinner” patterns), Agile is often a cost risk.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h5 mt-3">If you can shift EV, battery, or appliance use overnight</h3>
      <p>
        This is where Agile can shine. The 2025 national <strong>cheapest 3.5-hour block average</strong> is <strong>{{ stats_cheapest_block_avg_p_per_kwh }}p/kWh</strong>.
        If you can move flexible demand (EV charging, home batteries, washing/drying) into cheaper windows, you’re more likely to benefit.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        To keep assumptions explicit, the site’s stats use <strong>{{ stats_daily_kwh }} kWh/day</strong>. Under that assumption, the
        <strong>price cap comparison saving</strong> is £{{ stats_price_cap_annual_saving_gbp }}/year ({{ stats_daily_kwh }} kWh/day).
        And if you compare against a household paying peak-only rates, the <strong>{{ stats_shift_fraction_percent | default("", true) }}% load shifting vs peak-only usage saving</strong> is
        £{{ stats_shift_vs_peak_annual_saving_gbp }}/year.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h5 mt-3">If you’re home all day vs evenings only</h3>
      <p class="mb-0">
        “Home all day” can actually help if it spreads demand outside the evening peak (for example, running appliances earlier).
        The opposite pattern—minimal daytime use, heavy evening use—concentrates demand into the expensive window and often makes Agile worse.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>4) Region matters (identical behaviour can cost more or less)</h2>
      <p class="mb-0">
        Even if two households use electricity the same way, they can pay different amounts because Agile prices vary by UK region.
        National averages are useful for understanding the trade‑offs, but they are not enough for a decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        The practical next step is to verify the conclusion using your region’s data:
        <a href="{{ url_for('main.index') }}">enter your postcode</a> to detect your region, then open the regional pricing tools to see today’s cheap windows and the “worst time to use energy”.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        The <a href="{{ url_for('main.regions') }}">All Regions</a> page also lets you click into your region’s full prices page with charts and highlighted cheapest/worst windows.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="mb-4">
      <h2>Conclusion: Agile is a trade-off, not a win button</h2>
      <p>
        The honest summary is simple: Octopus Agile is not always cheaper. It rewards households that can avoid expensive peak hours—especially winter evenings—and it penalises those that can’t.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-0">
        National averages explain how Agile behaves — but they should never decide your tariff.
        The correct way to assess Agile is to look at your region’s live prices and compare them to when your household actually uses electricity.
        Start on the <a href="{{ url_for('main.index') }}">homepage</a> to detect your region by postcode, then review today’s cheapest and worst windows using the regional pricing tools.
